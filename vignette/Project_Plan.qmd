## App Context

Over the last couple presidential elections the balance between the Republican and Democratic support has shifted dramatically across the US. “Purple states” commonly refer to the fluctuations between the two parties. These swing states are usually the determining factor in what party wins the presidency. This project's purpose is to analyze how voting patterns in these states have evolved from 1976-2020.

## Lit Review

Purple states have played a crucial role in deciding U.S. presidential elections for decades. According to the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, these swing states swing the pendulum between Republican and Democratic majorities. Which is often the deicing factor in who wins the presidency (MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2021). Voter behavior in purple states is more dramatic than in a strong red or blue states. In presidential elections from 1976 to 2020, voter turnout in battleground states like Florida and Ohio were consistently higher than in non-swing states sometimes by as much as 5 to 7 percent (Hill, 2013; McKee & Teigen, 2013). These states also show how quickly party support shifts across counties. One study even showed that nearly 30 percent of counties in key swing states changed party preference between consecutive elections(Hill, 2013)

The foundation of the Electoral College is definitely contributing to the phenomenon of purple states. The U.S. Electoral College assigns votes based on state populations. Unless it’s a divided states, in which case  a small margin in votes can swing all the electoral votes. The Election Assistance Commission explains that this winner-take-all system exists in 48 states and means a candidate can win key states without winning a majority of votes nationally (U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 2011). Campaigns tend to focus on high voter turnout in battleground states while largely ignoring states with predictable outcomes (McKee & Teigen, 2013).

## Primary User and Questions of Interest 

Our primary user would be a political data analyst, journalist, or even a campaign strategist. They would use our app to understand historical voting trends in different areas of the country. The questions a user would use our app to answer would be one of the following. 

- Which states have experienced the greatest partisan shifts between 1976 and 2020?
- How have margins of victory changed in traditional swing states like Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania?
- Are there regional trends in polarization or competitiveness?

## Ethics Review Across the Data Science Lifestyle
**References to the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)**

First, when it comes to how we frame our questions of interest/purpose, we need to frame this as a descriptive historical analysis. Ethical concerns can come into play in this stage of the data science life cycle if we frame our questions or intent in a partisan manner, or if we exclude any information to make a specific point clearer. We can tie this to ACM principle 2.5 to give comprehensive and thorough evaluations. 

Second, we got our data from a reputable source and ensured we were able to use it for our project with no legal concerns. This lines up with ACM codes 1.3 to be honest and trustworthy, and 2.8 to access resources only when authorized. 

Third, when cleaning our data we need to ensure we are not cleaning in a biased way, avoid cherry picking to push our results in a given direction, and make sure we don't make any irreversible changes to the data. These align with ACM codes 2.1 to achieve high quality, 2.2 maintain professional competence, and 1.3 to maintain honesty. 

Finally, we need to make sure that our models and data evaluation are easily interpretable, even to those whole may not be well versed in data interpretation and analysis. There cannot be misleading representation, difficult to understand charts or explanations, or a partisan framing. This aligns with ACM codes 1.4 to be fair and take action to not discriminate, and 2.1 to strive for quality in both the processes and products of professional work.

## App Concept

### General Layout

The general layout of the app could have an election map where the user can enter a given election year and see the mapping of red, blue, and purple states throughout the years with a statistical breakdown for each purple state. This breakdown could include information about who was running for election, and the split of voters who voted for each party. We can include explanations for what each part of the statistical evidence means for how polarization has changed the impact/presence of swing states in the US. 

### Options for Users

Users should be able to choose data for a specific year through a drop down menu, and be able to explore the data via an overall election map and a breakdown of results from an individual swing state basis. This will allow them to easily view different graphs and statistical breakdowns without having to have any previous knowledge of data analysis.
