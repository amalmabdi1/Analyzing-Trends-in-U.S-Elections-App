# App Title  
**Analyzing Trends in U.S. Elections (1976–2020)**  

### App Purpose 
As U.S. politics has grown increasingly polarized, understanding voting trends across different levels of government is more important than ever. Patterns that appear in presidential races often look quite different when we examine congressional and gubernatorial elections, and these differences can reveal a great deal about how and why citizens vote.
At the same time, demographic characteristics such as age, race, gender, education, and income shape the electorate in ways that are not always obvious from results alone. This app is designed to make those relationships easier to see and interpret.\

### What the App Does  
Using data from federal and state elections, combined with detailed demographic information, this app allows users to:

- Select states, election levels, and time periods between 1976 and 2020  
- Visualize changes in partisan support and voter turnout over time  
- Explore how electoral outcomes correlate with demographic characteristics  

### Data  
All data used in this app comes from publicly available databases.  
No API keys are required to run the app.\
